in recent times, there has been lot of onsite accidents and attendance issues which companies are finding hard to trace due to following of traditional register based tracking method

Insights are provided into following key areas:

Team performance analysis: every team member preformance is analysed relative to other team member and with threshold standards set by the companies


Executive Summary
Overview of Findings
Individual parameters of employees like Attendance, on-time delivery and training sessions attendance for employees was low from January 2024 onwards
The average attendance was 10 to 13 days out of 26 days.
The on-site accidental cases was on the rise which can be contributed to either lack of training or behavioural issues on the working site.
Since the recording system was in manual way (maintain Register) and the contract was collaborative between companies, there were errors and hence lack of accountability
