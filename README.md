- all these companies have collaborated and provided with employees who holds expretise in various fields like plumbing, electrician, metal cuting etcâ€¦
in recent times, there has been lot of onsite accidents and attendance issues which companies are finding hard to trace due to following of traditional register based tracking method<br>

Insights are provided into following key areas:<br>
Individual employee analysis: this segment is sub-divided into various categories and focuses on individual employee's performance<br>
Team performance analysis: every team member preformance is analysed relative to other team member and with threshold standards set by the companies<br>


**Executive Summary**<br>
Overview of Findings: <br>
- Individual parameters of employees like Attendance, on-time delivery and training sessions attendance for employees was low from January 2024 onwards<br>
- The average attendance was 10 to 13 days out of 26 days.<br>
- The on-site accidental cases was on the rise which can be contributed to either lack of training or behavioural issues on the working site.<br>
- Since the recording system was in manual way (maintain Register) and the contract was collaborative between companies, there were errors and hence lack of accountability<br>
